# Changes

If you add or remove domains, please make sure to list them with the link or the related service

For example :

- Added `yopmail.com` (disposable) used by Dropmail https://dropmail.me
- Added `supere.ml` (disposable) used by Dropmail https://dropmail.me
- Added `angelic.com` (freemail) used by Mail.com https://signup.mail.com

Please Keep the list sorted :)

PS: Simple way to add domains while keeping the list sorted :

`yarn add-domain [CATEGORY] [DOMAIN]`

(for example `yarn add-domain freemail gmail.com`)
